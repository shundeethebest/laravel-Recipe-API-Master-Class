# Recipe App

You might not have realized this, but recipes are nothing more than culinary algorithms. Like programs, recipes are a series of imperative steps which, if followed correctly, result in a tasty dish.

The objective of the Recipe app is to help the user manage recipes in a way that will make them easy to follow.
